This is my ID assignment 1 repo

Overview
The main purpose that I wanted my website to be able to fulfil is to be a platform where products can be sold. The product category that I chose was sneakers and apparels. The name of the website is Drop. The website will be easy to use and also have easy to read cues, so as to not let the user be confused as to where they need to click next.
